So I built TWiM, a tool that finds concerts and builds playlists for them automatically. Fortunately for me, there are plenty of city-specific websites that have info on upcoming concerts! My idea was simple: write a program that would load the artists for the next week and make a Spotify playlist using &lt;a href="https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.25.2/"&gt;spotipy&lt;/a&gt;. Easy enough, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why I Retooled My Website</title><link>http://localhost:1313/blog/retoolwebsite/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/retoolwebsite/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="why-revive-a-website-4-years-later"&gt;Why Revive A Website 4 Years Later?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a website for a while, about 2021ish. It was an &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m bored&amp;rdquo; pandemic project meant to showcase my work. I always wanted a website, but making one still requires deciding on a framework, getting a theme that fits you, and then debugging all of the tiny little problems. Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s not hard but it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly common. More and more I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that personal websites need to make a comeback. Here&amp;rsquo;s a few thoughts on why I&amp;rsquo;m devoting more time to writing posts on my personal website.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
