So I built TWiM, a tool that finds concerts and builds playlists for them automatically. Fortunately for me, there are plenty of city-specific websites that have info on upcoming concerts! My idea was simple: write a program that would load the artists for the next week and make a Spotify playlist using &lt;a href="https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.25.2/"&gt;spotipy&lt;/a&gt;. Easy enough, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
