[{"categories":null,"contents":"I love listening to concerts, but it\u0026rsquo;s often tough to find bands playing in time to buy tickets, let alone decide if I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth it to spend my time and money to go and support new artists. So I built TWiM, a tool that finds concerts and builds playlists for them automatically. Fortunately for me, there are plenty of city-specific websites that have info on upcoming concerts! My idea was simple: write a program that would load the artists for the next week and make a Spotify playlist using spotipy. Easy enough, right?\nUnfortunately We Need an LLM Well, not exactly an LLM by 2025 standards, but we do need a model that can be adapted to understand band names. This is an issue because the formatting of artists is remarkably inconsistent. For example:\nAustralian punk night presents: THE CHATS / COSMIC PSYCHOS / THE SCHIZOPHONICS\nThis is challenging to parse with traditional methods because there\u0026rsquo;s text at the beginning, the bands are separated from each other by slashes, and they\u0026rsquo;re in all caps. None of this is guaranteed to be consistent, which further complicates the problem. At this point, this project graduates from a simple task to a named entity recognition (NER) problem. Even though this seems daunting, all I really had to do was download a pretrained network and adapt it to figure out what parts of a sentence belonged to an artist. After labeling a few hundred band names (plenty of podcasts were consumed during this) and without too much training, I had a model that could find band names that I could run on my local machine. This ends up being a robust solution: a small, locally hosted language model that is flexible to all kinds of inputs. It runs incredibly quickly, even on older hardware and had a \u0026gt;90% precision on my holdout set.\nMaking the Playlist Making the actual playlist presented more problems than I initially accounted for. For one, there are way more artists than you would want to stuff in a playlist. Ulimately, I landed on using 100 songs, with the top 15 artists (from Spotify\u0026rsquo;s metrics) getting 3 songs each, and 55 random artists getting one song. The goal of this project is to be one part music discovery and one part informative. I find this allows smaller artists to be discovered while highlighting bigger artists so you know who\u0026rsquo;s playing in your city. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is a perfect system but I\u0026rsquo;ve found plenty of artists so far that I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed listening to.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next? At this point, there are many options for the TWiM project. The first goal is to generate more focused playlists. The current playlists tend to be weighted towards specific genres as well as big artists that I don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy as much. For example, it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to find country music in Austin and it tends to flood the list with smaller country artists.\nA huge opportunity is personalization, which I\u0026rsquo;m currently testing with my profile. There\u0026rsquo;s no reason to not look out over a longer period of 3-6 months and find artists that I like so I can build a playlist that has music I already listen. This fulfills the \u0026ldquo;informative\u0026rdquo; mandate. However, I can also begin to aggregate a personal profile and find new artists that fit this profile.\nMusic Discovery With Less Algorithms The music discovery aspect of this project is actually an emergent feature of this project. When I first started looking for a way to compile upcoming artists into a playlist, I mostly was thinking about how I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to miss out on another concert. However, every week or so I find a new artist with a song I really enjoy and end up adding to my liked songs.\nThe idea of \u0026ldquo;algorithmless\u0026rdquo; music discovery doesn\u0026rsquo;t really make sense to me. I understand the desire to not be stuck in the same handful of songs, which undeniably happens all the time on Spotify. I think the TWiM project strikes a good balance here. The algorithm is completely transparent in how music is selected, enabling new music to be discovered without limitations on artist popularity or other unseen metrics. A final challenge for this project will be striking a better balance between 3 categories of artists that appear: huge artists with millions of plays, upcoming artists who are just gaining traction, and complete unknowns.\nIf you like this idea, please give the playlist a listen or a follow!

I\u0026rsquo;ve had a website for a while, about 2021ish. It was an \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m bored\u0026rdquo; pandemic project meant to showcase my work. I always wanted a website, but making one still requires deciding on a framework, getting a theme that fits you, and then debugging all of the tiny little problems. Overall, it\u0026rsquo;s not hard but it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly common. More and more I\u0026rsquo;m convinced that personal websites need to make a comeback. Here\u0026rsquo;s a few thoughts on why I\u0026rsquo;m devoting more time to writing posts on my personal website.\nPersonal Websites are Contained Ecosystems I\u0026rsquo;ve been on the internet for a long time and grew up in a strong stranger danger environment. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any hard data on how often this actually happened, but we were often given presentations from police officers at school about the dangers of online chatrooms. This eventually merged into anti-bullying campaigns. They even made a movie about it on ABC Family! Being an unlikable middle schooler, none of this really impacted me at the time. But I do think a strong message percolated into my brain: anonymity online is important. If you\u0026rsquo;re anonymous, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot harder to get bullied. And if you stay anonymous, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot harder for someone to keep tabs on what you say or target you.\nUnfortunately, I can\u0026rsquo;t stay anonymous forever. A personal website is good for sharing online thought because it\u0026rsquo;s a centralized object that I control. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to have a comment section. I can add or remove things at my will, not someone else\u0026rsquo;s, and if I want to blow it all up one day, I will. This breaks my anonymity rule but gives me enough control for my own liking.\nMy Old Website Sucked I built my old website using the first tutorial I found with Jekyll, and I hated it. Generally, I don\u0026rsquo;t like using tools that I don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand. So running random commands and troubleshooting bundler and Ruby gems was really frustrating for me. Eventually, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even update the site and sort of gave up on it.\nRevisiting this, I first thought about using Python because I know it fairly well. I\u0026rsquo;ve made websites with Flask in the past and thought it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too hard. I first made a site with Pelican but did not really love any of the themes. I was inspired to really strong-arm the CSS into something I liked but decided that would take too long. I ultimately landed on Hugo because it had good documentation and much better themes. While not Python-based, Hugo had very customizable websites with landing pages, blog style posts, and much more.\nI\u0026rsquo;m Too Opinionated As a scientist, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty opinionated, but I struggle to share these opinions with others. Online, I don\u0026rsquo;t really love commenting on someone\u0026rsquo;s post. Even if they\u0026rsquo;re saying something completely incorrect, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot more peaceful to move on to the next post. But I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that generally the bioinformatics/computational biology space is dominated by a handful of people online. Outside of these people, it\u0026rsquo;s a whole lot of AI-generated content. We really should be better than this, even if we aren\u0026rsquo;t. Too many people are frightened of the command line, are absolutely convinced that AI will replace scientists/artists/union pipe fitters, or utterly unconcerned about responsible computing. I want to put my thoughts into the world so there\u0026rsquo;s at least some pushback.\nEndeavoring to Create Content Making content of any kind is hard. It was difficult just getting this site going. But ultimately I have some unique insights into computing and biology that not a lot of people have. If you\u0026rsquo;re reading this, my promise is that I will make content. I can\u0026rsquo;t promise that it will be interesting, but I can promise that it\u0026rsquo;ll be written by me and it\u0026rsquo;ll be something I wish I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to figure out on my own. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to share my thoughts about science, communication, technology, and my own personal projects that I haven\u0026rsquo;t really been able to showcase!\n","permalink":"https://jost.engineer/blog/retoolwebsite/","tags":["compbio","programming","personal"],"title":"Why I Retooled My Website"},{"categories":null,"contents":"3rd job: CIO As Chief Information Officer at Internet Affairs Inc., I lead the strategic transformation of our digital infrastructure and cybersecurity initiatives.
