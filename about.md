I'm passionate about solving problems and helping people. That's why I wanted to get my PhD: so that I could do research that I find meaningful. 

Here are some of the organizations I am involved with:

The [Brock Lab](http://www.brocklab.com/) at UT Austin is my home lab where I am advised. 

I am also a member of the [Center for Computational Oncology](https://cco.oden.utexas.edu/).

I also tutor math for [Austin Partners in Education](https://austinpartners.org/). 

In my free time I enjoy reading books, watching TV, playing video games, and taking walks to look at the beautiful neighborhoods in Austin. Occasionally I like to program something if I think it will be useful for others. My COVID hobby is playing tennis.
