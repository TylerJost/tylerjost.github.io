   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is my first post for my website. Ever since I was a kid, I wanted a website. Why? I am not sure, but I definitely thought it would be cool. Back then, most online communication was done through forums and personal websites like those hosted on angelfire and freewebs.com. I even borrowed a book from the library about how to make a website. The allure of people visiting my website (purpose still undefined) and making a visitor counter made of flames rapidly rise was apparently very strong. Unfortunately, learning to change the color of a website is relatively dull so I never ended up getting a domain name. I think this desire remained, however, so when a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dayl.in/&quot;&gt;coworker&lt;/a&gt; made his own my interest was renewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goals for this website are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To showcase my work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To have a permanent place on the internet where people can find out more information about me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To make useful tools and write useful tutorials for people wanting to learn something new.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To do something new and fun and interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
